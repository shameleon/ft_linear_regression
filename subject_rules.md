From now on you must follow these
additional rules
• No code in the global scope. Use functions!
• Each program must have its main and not be a simple script:

```python
def main():
# your tests and your error handling
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()
```

• Any exception not caught will invalidate the exercices, even in the event of an error
that you were asked to test.
• All your functions must have a documentation (__doc__)
• Your code must be at the norm
◦ pip install flake8
◦ alias norminette=flake8
