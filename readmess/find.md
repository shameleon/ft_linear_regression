Training a linear regression model using a gradient descent algorithm involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide:

    Initialize the model parameters: Start by initializing the model parameters, usually with random values. In the case of linear regression, these parameters are the coefficients of the model geeksforgeeks.org.

   import numpy as np

   # Assume we have one feature in our dataset
   theta = np.random.rand(2)

    Calculate the model predictions: Use the initial parameters to calculate predictions. In a simple linear regression model, an input is multiplied by the coefficients and summed to give a prediction machinelearningmastery.com.

   def predict(X, theta):
       return np.dot(X, theta)

    Calculate the cost: The cost function measures the error between the model predictions and the actual values. For linear regression, the cost function is usually the mean squared error datacamp.com.

   def compute_cost(X, y, theta):
       predictions = predict(X, theta)
       errors = np.subtract(predictions, y)
       sqrErrors = np.square(errors)
       J = 1 / (2 * m) * np.sum(sqrErrors)

       return J

    Update the model parameters: Use the gradient descent algorithm to update the parameters. The parameters are updated iteratively to minimize the cost function geeksforgeeks.org.

   def gradient_descent(X, y, theta, alpha, iterations):
       cost_history = np.zeros(iterations)

       for i in range(iterations):
           predictions = predict(X, theta)
           errors = np.subtract(predictions, y)
           sum_delta = (alpha / m) * X.transpose().dot(errors);
           theta = theta - sum_delta;

           cost_history[i] = compute_cost(X, y, theta)

       return theta, cost_history

    Repeat the process: Repeat the prediction, cost calculation, and parameter update steps for a number of iterations or until the cost function converges to a minimum machinelearningmastery.com.

    Evaluate the model: After the model parameters have been learned, use them to make predictions on new data and evaluate the model's performance. For regression tasks, common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or root mean squared error (RMSE) machinelearningmastery.com.

Note that the gradient descent algorithm is not used to calculate the coefficients for linear regression in practice, as it is slower and less efficient than a least squares solution. However, it does provide a useful exercise for learning stochastic gradient descent, an important algorithm used for minimizing cost functions by machine learning algorithms machinelearningmastery.com.

As for the perceptron, it's a different machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It's not directly related to linear regression or gradient descent, though it does use a similar concept of learning weights from data. The perceptron algorithm updates its weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual classes for each instance in the training dataset. It's not clear how a perceptron would be used in conjunction with linear regression and gradient descent in the context of your question.
